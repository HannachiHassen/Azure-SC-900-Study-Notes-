# Module 2 — Microsoft Identity & Access Management

## 🔐 2.1 Microsoft Entra ID Overview
Entra ID is Microsoft’s cloud identity provider.

### Key Capabilities  
- Authentication  
- Authorization  
- Conditional Access  
- Single Sign-On (SSO)  
- Identity governance  
- Privileged Identity Management  

---

## 👤 2.2 Authentication Methods
- Password  
- Passwordless (FIDO2, Windows Hello, Authenticator app)  
- SMS/voice  
- Certificate-based auth  
- Hardware tokens  

### MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)  
2+ factors:  
- Something you know  
- Something you have  
- Something you are  

---

## 🎟️ 2.3 Conditional Access (CA)
If X, then Y access policies.

### CA Examples  
- Require MFA for risky sign-in  
- Block access from untrusted countries  
- Require compliant device  

CA combines **signals + decisions + enforcement**.

---

## 🔄 2.4 Single Sign-On (SSO)
SSO enables access to multiple apps with one identity.

### Types  
- SAML  
- OAuth 2.0  
- OIDC  
- Password SSO  

---

### Risk Types  
- User risk  
- Sign-in risk  
- Risk detection events  

Automatic responses can enforce:  
- Password reset  
- MFA  
- Blocking access  

---

## 🔑 2.6 Privileged Access  
Use **PIM (Privileged Identity Management)** to manage:  
- Just-in-Time (JIT) permissions  
- Reduce standing privilege  
- Approval workflows  

---

## 🧭 2.7 Identity Governance  
Ensures the right people have the right access:

- Access reviews  
- Entitlement management  
- Lifecycle workflows  

---

## 📝 Exam Tips  
- Know CA uses "if/then" logic  
- Know PIM = JIT + approval  
- Understand MFA & passwordless options  
- Identify OAuth vs SAML vs OIDC correctly
